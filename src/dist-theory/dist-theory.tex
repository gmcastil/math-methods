\section{The Dirac $\delta$-Function}

The $\delta$-function can be defined in several different ways.  The
simplest is to say that
%
\begin{equation*}
  \delta(x) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
      0 & : x \neq 0\\
      \infty & : x = 0
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation*}
%
with $\delta(0)$ being infinite in such a way that
%
\begin{equation*}
  \int_a^b dx\,\delta(x) = 1
\end{equation*}
for $a < 0 < b$ (since $\delta(x) = 0$ for $x \neq 0$ this integral is
independent of $a$ and $b$, so long as $a < 0 < b$).

A second possibility is to define $\delta(x)$ to be the limit as $n
\rightarrow \infty$ of a
